Here is a path to a Qt C++ file that implements the functionality I want to build here in Swift.
The function loadCuesheets takes a filename, and finds all of the cuesheets that match the filename.
The list of possible cuesheets was already created in pathStackCuesheets.  loadCuesheets calls betterFindPossibleCuesheets() to do the hard work of matching, using several matching algorithms.  The results from betterFindPossibleCuesheets are returned in possibleCuesheets, and then loadCuesheets() will populate the dropdown list (here called comboBoxCuesheetSelector) with all of the possible cuesheets, and it will set the selection to be the lastCuesheet column in the database associated with the currently loaded song.
The C++ code does a lot more than that, so we will need to retain only the functions that we need for this iPad project, and we'll ignore the rest.  Make sure that the cuesheet name matching code after translation to Swift is in a place that is easy to find, so I can review it.  Don't start making changes until you understand the task. Ask me clarifying questions if you need to.

The path to the Qt C++ cuesheet matching code is here:

**Clarifying access needs**

I need to ensure that we understand each other before making any changes. The us
er shared a path to a Qt C++ file from a different project, but since our enviro
nment operates in a sandbox, I can't access that external path unless it’s expli
citly allowed. I’ll have to ask the user to either paste the relevant code or gr
ant us access. Plus, we need to define the scope for implementing cue sheet matc
hing in Swift within the iSquareDesk project.**Gathering details for cuesheets**

I’m figuring out what I need for the cuesheets functionality. First, I’ll requir
e a data source, possibly from a folder in the music directory or embedded resou
rces. I need to port the betterFindPossibleCuesheets algorithm from C++ and crea
te a loadCuesheets function to handle song filenames and populate dropdowns. The
 user mentioned wanting to translate the matching code but preferred to pause mo
difications until we understand everything. I’ll ask clarifying questions about
where cuesheets are located and what pathStackCuesheets refers to.**Clarifying p
roject details**

I need to get clear information about a few things for this project. First, I sh
ould check which directories we are referencing. Is there a lastCuesheet column
in the database schema, and in which table can we find it? We might need to exte
nd our database manager to fetch this info. As for the Qt file, could the user p
rovide the relevant functions or a high-level description of the matching algori
thms? We might need to see the code to properly port it over. Finally, are we fo
cusing on using SwiftUI with WKWebView for HTML display?**Organizing cuesheet de
tails**

I’m happy to report that the bottom portion is now swipeable! Next, I need to de
cide where to store the matching code; I think placing it in a new Swift file, M
atching/CuesheetMatcher.swift, would make it easy to locate.

We also need clarification on the lastCuesheet column—specifically its name and
location in the database. I should propose a plan but not implement it yet, mayb
e using an update_plan function. I’ll craft a concise message to ask the user fo
r the C++ code, file types, paths, and how to address potential no matches!

codex
Got it. Before I port the matching logic, a few clarifications so I mirror your
Qt behavior precisely:

- Source code access: I can’t read files outside this workspace. Could you paste
 the relevant functions from your Qt file (at least loadCuesheets, betterFindPos
sibleCuesheets, and any helpers they call), or drop that file into this repo? Ev
en a trimmed version with just the matching logic is fine.

- Cuesheet location and types:
  - Where are cuesheets stored relative to the Music Folder? One folder or multi
ple (e.g., “cuesheets”, “reference”, etc.)?
  - What file types should we consider for matching (.html, .htm, .rtf, .pdf, .t
xt)?
  - Is pathStackCuesheets supposed to be a pre-scanned list of full file paths f
rom those folders?

- Database integration:
  - Which table/column stores lastCuesheet? Is it songs.lastCuesheet? What’s the
 type and format (full path, relative path, display name)?
  - Do you want me to update that column when the user changes the dropdown sele
ction, or just read and preselect it?

- Matching behavior details:
  - Should I reproduce exact Qt heuristics (e.g., exact base-name match, case/pu
nctuation-insensitive, stripping label prefixes, fuzzy contains, regex variants)
? Or is a subset acceptable initially?
  - Any special handling for “vocals”/“singing” vs “patter”, or label/title comb
os?

- UX specifics:
  - If there are 0 matches, what should the dropdown show (empty, “No cuesheets
found”, or fallback file)?
  - If there are multiple matches, should the lastCuesheet (from DB) be selected
 if present, else the first match?

Implementation plan (once the above is clear and I have the code):
- Add a dedicated Swift file, e.g., CuesheetMatcher.swift, that contains the por
ted matching logic (easy to find/review).
- Build pathStackCuesheets by scanning the configured cuesheet directories and f
ile types.
- Implement loadCuesheets(songFilename:), call betterFindPossibleCuesheets, popu
late the CuesheetView dropdown, and preselect lastCuesheet from DB.
- Wire selection changes to update the DB (if desired), and load the selected cu
esheet into the HTML view.

Send me the Qt matching functions (or grant access by placing the file here), an
d confirm the storage/DB details, and I’ll proceed.

user
Cuesheets in the Music Folder are mostly in the lyrics subfolder.  Some may be elsewhere.
Lyrics filetypes: .htm .html
pathStackCuesheets: yes, this is a pre-scanned list of full file paths
table name: songs, column name for preferred cuesheet: last_cuesheet
When the user changes the dropdown, right now I do not want you to make any changes to the column in the DB.  We will change this requirement later.
Matching behavior: yes, exact match of Qt heuristics is desired.
Special handling: patter songs do not have a cuesheet at all.  singing and vocals usually do have a cuesheet.  If the Type is blank, then no cuesheets for that song.
If 0 matches, just leave it blank.
If multiple matches, then order them by their score, which is calculated by the C++ code.  Then select the one that matches last_cuesheet.  If last_cuesheet is blank, the dropdown list should show the cuesheet name with the highest score.
No updating of the database right now, so don't wire dropdown changes to the DB yet.

**Planning Cuesheet Update**

Before jumping into logic, I want to define the ObservedObject model: CuesheetVi
ewModel with @Published items and selection. Then ContentView will set it when t
he song loads. I’m thinking it could be simpler to pass a Binding to the items a
nd selection.

For now, I’ll scaffold the hooking by adding CuesheetMatcher.swift with the mode
l and updating ContentView to hold @State for cuesheet files and selection. I re
alize we can't start coding just yet until everything is clear, so I’ll propose
a plan without code changes for now.**Proposing Cuesheet Implementation**

They've asked me to ensure the cuesheet name matching code in Swift is easy to f
ind. I can create a file called 'CuesheetMatcher.swift' with a TODO note. We sho
uld implement scanning for pathStackCuesheets and DB retrieval, but the heuristi
cs porting is still pending. I think it’s best to stub out the match function to
 return an empty response for now while we wait for the exact heuristics.

Here’s my proposed plan:

1. Add CuesheetMatcher.swift with necessary data structures and a public API.
2. Extend SongDatabaseManager with a read-only `last_cuesheet` fetch.
3. Connect ContentView/CuesheetView to accept files and selections without DB up
dates.**Preparing for Heuristics Implementation**

Once the Qt code arrives, I’ll implement the heuristics and place it in a dedica
ted section with clear comments.

I need to confirm a couple of details:

- Can we scan the entire music folder for .htm/.html files, starting with the ly
rics subfolder?
- Should the `last_cuesheet` be stored as a relative path or just the base filen
ame?

Additionally, do you prefer cuesheets displayed by their base name or relative p
aths? I can also derive relative paths for DB matching. I’ll keep this concise a
nd clear while proposing the plan and asking for the code to be pasted.

codex
Thanks — I have what I need to wire this up cleanly. One blocker: I can’t read f
iles outside this workspace, so I can’t open /Users/mpogue/clean3/… directly. If
 you paste the relevant Qt functions (at least loadCuesheets, betterFindPossible
Cuesheets, and helpers they call) here, or drop that file into this repo, I’ll p
ort the heuristics exactly.

Proposed integration plan (keeps matcher easy to find)
- New file: iSquareDesk/iSquareDesk/CuesheetMatcher.swift
  - Public API:
    - buildPathStackCuesheets(musicFolder: URL) -> [URL] scans for .htm/.html (p
rioritize lyrics/ but include anywhere).
    - betterFindPossibleCuesheets(songFile: URL, songType: String, pathStackCues
heets: [URL]) -> [MatchResult] where MatchResult = { url, displayName, score }.
    - loadCuesheets(songFile: URL, songType: String, lastCuesheet: String?, path
StackCuesheets: [URL]) -> (items: [String], selectedIndex: Int?, matches: [Match
Result]).
  - I’ll port your Qt heuristics into betterFindPossibleCuesheets — clearly sect
ioned and commented for review.

- Database read-only support
  - SongDatabaseManager: add getLastCuesheet(for relativeSongPath: String) -> St
ring? (reads songs.last_cuesheet). No writes wired yet, per your requirement.

- UI wiring
  - CuesheetView will accept bindings for:
    - files: [String] (dropdown items)
    - selectedFile: String?
    - htmlContent: String
  - ContentView: when a song loads and Type is “singing” or “vocals”, call loadC
uesheets(...) and populate CuesheetView; if Type is blank or “patter”, leave dro
pdown empty. If multiple matches, sort by score and pre-select last_cuesheet if
present; otherwise the top-scoring item. No DB update on user selection for now.

Open questions (to match exactly)
- Please paste the Qt matching code (loadCuesheets, betterFindPossibleCuesheets,
 and helpers). I’ll port it verbatim in logic and flag any platform-specific adj
ustments.
- last_cuesheet format: is it stored as a relative path (from music folder), bas
e filename, or full path? I’ll match against that format when pre-selecting.
- Dropdown display: should it show base filenames without extension, or relative
 path within the music folder (e.g., lyrics/MySong.html)?

Once I have the Qt code snippet, I’ll implement CuesheetMatcher.swift, add the D
B read, and wire it to the CuesheetView.

user
Yes, scan the entire Music Folder for .htm and .html cuesheets.  Ideally, this can be done once at app startup while the splash screen is being viewed, so that it takes no user-perceived time.
last_cuesheet is stored as an absolute pathname.  There is a function called convertCuesheetPathNameToCurrentRoot() in MainWindow.cpp that will convert an absolute pathname on any system to an absolute pathname on the current system.
I've provided both cpp files in the Qt_source subdirectory.  Let me know if you need any more files to be placed there.

codex
I’ll read the provided Qt C++ files in Qt_source and port the matching logic int
o a new CuesheetMatcher.swift, then wire scanning and dropdown preselection.

**Addressing missing files**

I’ve noticed there’s no Qt_source present, so I need to inform the user about th
at and ask them to add the necessary files. I should also clarify where I'll pla
ce the Swift code and outline the integration steps. I’m thinking of scaffolding
 the CuesheetMatcher.swift file with placeholders and implementing scanning at s
tartup during the splash screen. I’ll take a look at AppLaunchView.swift to see
how best to proceed.

**Planning implementation steps**

I’m planning to add scanning during the splash screen before it fades out. Howev
er, since we can’t implement matching without the Qt code, I’ll create the scaff
olding: CuesheetMatcher.swift with placeholders for functions and a TODO comment
 regarding the matching port. I’m considering using a shared singleton for pathS
tackCuesheets or creating a CuesheetManager class. I should ask the user to add
the missing files to the repo or paste the code since we can’t access Qt_source.
**Structuring the plan**

I’m proposing a structure and necessary steps, confirming that last_cuesheet is
absolute and that we need to port the convertCuesheetPathNameToCurrentRoot funct
ion. I should ask whether we should store pre-scanned pathStackCuesheets in a me
mory singleton. To keep things concise, I’ll request that the user adds the file
s to the Qt_source folder in the repo or pastes the contents. Plus, I need to co
nfirm the display policy for dropdown names and mention that scanning the entire
 Music Folder for .htm/.html is acceptable.

codex
Thanks for the details — I’m ready to implement, but I can’t see the Qt files ye
t.

I don’t have access to /Users/mpogue/clean3/SquareDesk/... from this workspace.
Please either:
- Add the two Qt files into this repo under a folder like Qt_source/, or
- Paste the relevant functions here (loadCuesheets, betterFindPossibleCuesheets,
 convertCuesheetPathNameToCurrentRoot, and any helpers they call).

Once I have them locally, I’ll:
- Add CuesheetMatcher.swift (clearly named and commented) with:
  - buildPathStackCuesheets(musicFolder) → [URL] scanning .htm/.html across the
entire Music Folder (prioritizes lyrics/ but includes anywhere).
  - betterFindPossibleCuesheets(songFile, songType, pathStack) → [MatchResult] i
mplementing the exact Qt heuristics with a score.
  - loadCuesheets(songFile, songType, lastCuesheetAbsPath, pathStack) → items +
selectedIndex (preselects last_cuesheet if present; else highest score; blank fo
r no matches; no DB writes).
  - convertCuesheetPathNameToCurrentRoot for absolute-path translation, ported f
rom your Qt function.
- Kick off a one-time scan at app startup (during splash) and cache pathStackCue
sheets in memory for fast lookups.
- Read last_cuesheet from songs.last_cuesheet (absolute path) and do not update
DB on selection changes (per your instruction).
- Show cuesheet display names in the dropdown (please confirm preferred label: b
ase filename without extension, or relative path like lyrics/Foo.html).

Once you drop or paste the Qt code, I’ll port the matcher heuristics verbatim an
d wire everything up.

I have placed the files into the Qt_source subdirectory of iSquareDesk.  Please add the Qt_source to the .gitignore file, so that these are not committed, and then proceed.

**Implementing Cuesheet Functionality**

I'm thinking about how to implement CuesheetMatcher and pathStack building. I'll
 need to modify ContentView to call matcher.loadCuesheets upon song load, adjust
ing CuesheetView accordingly. Previously, we set CuesheetView inside the TabView
 with default state, but now we'll change that to include specific parameters fr
om three new @State variables in ContentView. This means updating CuesheetView t
o accept those bindings, and for HTML display, we should read the file content d
irectly for correct loading.**Planning Cuesheet Implementation**

I’m thinking we need to populate the selection with cuesheets; if there are none
, it should stay blank. I should port betterFindPossibleCuesheets heuristics and
 list the relevant files. First, I'll proceed with tools to list iSquareDesk/Qt_
source and read the contents, adding a .gitignore line for iSquareDesk/Qt_source
/. Then, I'll implement CuesheetMatcher.swift and focus on interpreting those he
uristics. I also need to inspect mainwindow_cuesheets.cpp to help guide this pro
cess.

I think I should port the entire function since it's long. So far, I’ve only see

 the entire function body, so let’s search for the endpoints to get a complete v

**Analyzing function scoring**

I’m looking into the function MP3FilenameVsCuesheetnameScore, which involves mul
tiple complex steps. Each step is crucial: Step 2 gives a score of 100 for an ex
act match, while Steps 3 and 4 involve fuzzy matching. I noticed that the scorin
g process has many rules and our earlier extraction wasn't complete. I used awk
to grab everything up to the first "return score," but that only captured part o
f the function. To fully understand it, I need to count brackets and get the com
plete version.**Using sed for function extraction**

I'm considering using `sed` to extract the relevant function code instead of jus
t printing from the line number identified with `grep -n`. It would be easier to
 set a range from the start of the current function to the beginning of the next
 function, which in this case is "void MainWindow::betterFindPossibleCuesheets."
 By searching between these patterns, I can get exactly what I need for my analy
